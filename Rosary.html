                  <br>It is appropriate to begin the rosary with the virtue of humility. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that "Humility is the foundation of prayer. Only when we humbly acknowledge that we do not know how to pray as we ought, are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer. Man is a beggar before God." (CCC 2559)

                  <br>We live in a very consumerist culture. This mystery invites us to detach ourselves from our many possessions. What do we truly need and what is excess? What can we share with others?

                  <br>Mary and Joseph humbly brought Jesus to the temple in accord with Jewish law. Obedience to God and to others can be very difficult, but offers us the opportunity to subjugate our own will to that of our heavenly Father. Not my will, but God&apos;s will be done.
                <li class="MyText PBD5">Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple -  The Fruit of this mystery is Piety, Joy in finding Jesus
                  <br>Piety is dedication to the Church&apos;s sacramental life and devotions. Mary and Joseph were surprised to find Jesus in the temple. We, too, should be dedicated to our Church and the sacraments.

                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Visitation
                  <br>That missionaries who travel long roads bearing Christ to those in need may be strengthened in faith and holiness.
                <li class="MyText PBD3">The Birth of Jesus

              <ol>
                <li class="MyText PBD1"> The Baptism of Jesus:
                  <br>And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove. -- Matthew 3:16
                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Wedding Feast of Cana:
                  <br>Jesus said to her, "Woman, what concern is this to us? My hour has not yet come." His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you." ... This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee. -- John 2:4-5, 11
                <li class="MyText PBD3">The Preaching of the Kingdom:
                  <br>Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel." -- Mark 1:14-15
                <li class="MyText PBD4">The Transfiguration:
                  <br>And as [Jesus] was praying, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became dazzling white... And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!" -- Luke 9:29-35
                <li class="MyText PBD5">The Institution of the Eucharist:
                  <br>Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is my body." -- Matthew 26:26-27

              <ol>
                <li class="MyText PBD1">The Baptism of Jesus - I desire to live my Baptismal Promises
                  <br>Think of Christ&apos;s Baptism at the hands of John the Baptist when the Father called Him His Beloved Son and the Holy Spirit descended on Him to invest Him with the mission He was to carry out.
                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Miracle at Cana -  I desire to do Whatever Jesus says
                  <br>Think of Christ&apos;s self-manifestation at the wedding at Cana when He changed water into wine and opened the hearts of the disciples to faith, thanks to the intervention of Mary, the first among believers.
                <li class="MyText PBD3">The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God -  I desire for Go&apos;s forgiveness
                  <br>Think of Christ&apos;s preaching of the Kingdom of God with its call to forgiveness, as He inaugurated the ministry of Mercy, which He continues to exercise until the end of the world, particularly through the sacrament of Reconciliation.
                <li class="MyText PBD4"> The Transfiguration - I desire to become a new person in Christ
                  <br>Think of Christ&apos;s Transfiguration when the glory of the Godhead shone forth from His face as the Father commanded the Apostles to listen to Him and experience His Passion and Resurrection and be transfigured by the Holy Spirit.
                <li class="MyText PBD5">The Institution of the Eucharist - I desire for Active Participation at Mass
                  <br>
                  Think of Christ&apos;s institution of the Eucharist, in which He offered His Body and Blood as food under the signs of bread and wine and testified to His love for humanity, for whose sake He would offer Himself in sacrifice.
              </ol>

              <ol>
                <li class="MyText PBD1">The Baptism of Jesus -  The Fruit of this mystery is Openness to the Holy Spirit
                  <br>We each receive the Holy Spirit in a special way in Baptism and again at Confirmation. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. We need only ask the Holy Spirit for help and help will be provided.
                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Miracle at Cana -  The Fruit of this mystery is To Jesus through Mary
                  <br>Mary encouraged her Son to perform his first miracle at the Wedding at Cana. She simply told the servants to "do whatever he tells you." She helps us in a similar way - always pointing us to her Son and interceding on our behalf. We need only to turn to her and ask for help.
                <li class="MyText PBD3">Proclamation of the Kingdom of God -  The Fruit of this mystery is Repentance, Trust in God, Desire for holiness
                  <br>Jesus spent the active years of his ministry preaching and performing miracles to proclaim the Kingdom of God. He asks us to express sorrow from our sin, turn away from sin, and trust in God.
                <li class="MyText PBD4">Transfiguration -  The Fruit of this mystery is Desire for Holiness? Acknowledgement of Christ&apos;s Divinity
                  <br>Jesus gave three of his closest friends a glimpse of His glory at the Transfiguration. We, too, are called to holiness, and to ultimately live in glory in heaven. But, we need to want it and we need to want it more than what the world and the devil attempts to offer us.
                <li class="MyText PBD5">Institution of the Eucharist -  The Fruit of this mystery is Eucharistic Adoration, Active Participation at Mass
                  <br>Jesus gave us the greatest gift in the Eucharist. He gave us His very self. This mystery invites us to appreciate that gift fully and to participate at Mass often
              </ol>

              <ol>
                <li class="MyText PBD1">The Baptism in the Jordan
                  <br>In a hospital in Hong Kong, a Chinese Sister spoke to a young cancer patient about God, our loving Father, and about heaven, our eternal home. The boy, an orphan, told her: "I never had a father. I never had a home." Baptized, the boy made the journey to God clothed in Christ because a Sister had shared with him the fruits of her own baptism.
                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Wedding of Cana
                  <br>Mother Teresa tells of bringing rice to a hungry family. The next day she discovered the food was gone. It seems that a neighboring family had no food either, so the first family shared what Mother Teresa had brought them. The neighbors, of a different faith, were witnesses to Christian love.
                <li class="MyText PBD3">The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God and Call to Conversion
                  <br>In East Africa, a Catholic family heard of a village far from their own where the people had never heard of Christ. In prayer, and in love, they decided to move to the distant village so that day by day they could tell -- and show -- the people what it means to be a follower of Christ.
                <li class="MyText PBD4">The Transfiguration
                  <br>To catch even a glimpse of the glory that awaits us in Christ is a gift beyond compare for millions of people whose lives are a daily struggle. Such a glimpse was caught in Liberia, West Africa. When people by the hundreds fled from their homes in the midst of civil war, their pastor said, "They left all their belongings behind, but they brought with them one valuable possession -- their faith."
                <li class="MyText PBD5">The Institution of the Eucharist
                  <br>World Mission Sunday, celebrated each year on the next-to-last Sunday in October, in the context of the Mass, reminds us that we who eat Christ&apos;s Body and drink his Blood are sent to continue his mission to the world. "Supported by Mary, we will not hesitate to devote ourselves generously to taking the proclamation of the Good News to the ends of the earth," said Pope John Paul II.

              <ol>
                <li class="MyText PBD1"> The Agony in the Garden:
                  <br>And going a little farther [Jesus] fell on his face and prayed, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt." -- Matthew 26:39
                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Scourging:
                  <br>Then [Pilate] released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. -- Matthew 27:26
                <li class="MyText PBD3">The Crowning with Thorns:
                  <br>And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. -- Matthew 27:28-29
                <li class="MyText PBD4">The Carrying of the Cross:
                  <br>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him... They came upon a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; this man they compelled to carry his cross. -- Matthew 27:31-32
                <li class="MyText PBD5">The Crucifixion:
                  <br>And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split. -- Matthew 27:50-51

                <li class="MyText PBD1">The Agony in the Garden - I desire for True repentance for my sins
                  <br>Think of our Lord Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, suffering a bitter agony for our sins.
                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Scourging at the Pillar - I desire for a Spirit of Mortification
                  <br>Think of the cruel scourging at the pillar that our Lord suffered: the heavy blows that tore His flesh.
                <li class="MyText PBD3">The Crowning with Thorns - I desire for Moral Courage
                  <br>Think of the crown of sharp thorns that was forced upon our Lord&apos;s sacred Head and the patience with which He endured the pain for our sins.
                <li class="MyText PBD4">The Carrying of the Cross - I desire for the virtue of Patience
                  <br>Think of the heavy Cross, so willingly carried by our Lord, and ask Him to help you to carry your crosses without complaint
                <li class="MyText PBD5">The Crucifixion and death of our Lord - I desire for the grace of final Perseverance
                  <br>Think of the love which filled Christ&apos;s Sacred Heart during His three hours of agony on the Cross, and ask Him to be with you at the hour of death.

              <ol>
                <li class="MyText PBD1">Agony in the Garden -  The Fruit of this mystery is Contrition, Conformity to the Will of God
                  <br>Jesus, both fully human and fully divine, suffered immensely in the garden. He knew what was coming and he was terrified. He begged His Father to spare him, but submitted Himself fully to His will. We, too, are called to do this.
                <li class="MyText PBD2">Scourging at the Pillar -  The Fruit of this mystery is Purity, Mortification (control of one&apos;s senses)
                  <br>Mortification isn&apos;t popular these days, but making small sacrifices and offering them up can be a great help to one&apos;s spiritual life. There is an opportunity every day to sacrifice and to suffer in some small way.
                <li class="MyText PBD3">Crowning with Thorns -  The Fruit of this mystery is Moral Courage
                  <br>Jesus remained resolute even as he was being made fun of. Do we have the courage to stand up for our convictions even when we are being laughed at? Whose opinion matters more - God&apos;s or those who surround us?
                <li class="MyText PBD4">Carrying of the Cross -  The Fruit of this mystery is Patience
                  <br>Patience is something we all seem to have difficulty with. Jesus patiently carried his cross through the streets of Jerusalem on the way to his Crucifixion. We can look to him for help when we are tempted to lose our patience.
                <li class="MyText PBD5">Crucifixion -  The Fruit of this mystery is Salvation, Self-Denial, Perseverance
                  <br>Jesus gave up everything for us on the cross. His took on the sins of the world, past, present, and future, and died for our salvation. We need to be so thankful for that gift. At the same time, when we are asked to die to ourselves and put others first, we can look to the cross for the example of total self-giving.

                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Scourging at the Pillar
                  <br>That all who suffer in body, especially the hungry millions in the missions, may be fed and comforted through our sharing.
                <li class="MyText PBD3">The Crowning with Thorns
                  <br>That all those who suffer from despair, especially the refugees of the missions, may find hope in Christ&apos;s promise of eternal happiness for those who believe in Him.

                  <br>Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they did not know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. -- John 20:8
                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Ascension of the Lord:
                  <br>He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you." ... When he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. -- Acts 1:7-9
                <li class="MyText PBD3">The Descent of the Holy Spirit:
                  <br>There appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributed and resting on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. -- Acts 2:3-4

                <li class="MyText PBD5">The Crowning of Mary as Queen of Heaven:
                  <br>A great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. -- 1 Revelation 12:1

                  <br>Think of Christ&apos;s glorious triumph when, on the third day after His death, He arose from the tomb and for forty days appeared to His Blessed Mother and to His disciples.

                  <br>It takes great faith to believe that Jesus rose from the dead and that we, too, shall rise. As Jesus told his apostles, "Blessed are that who have not seen, and yet believe."  This mystery offers us help in maintaining that faith. "Lord, I believe. Please help my unbelief!"
                <li class="MyText PBD2">The Ascension -  The Fruit of this mystery is Hope, Desire for Heaven

                  <br>The disciples were scared. They huddled together in that upper room not sure of what to do. Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon them and they were ready to go out and give their very lives in service to God. May the Holy Spirit also grant us that wisdom and love of God.
                <li class="MyText PBD4">The Assumption of Mary -  The Fruit of this mystery is Devotion to Mary, Happy death
                  <br>Mary was brought up to heaven body and soul. We are devoted to her because of her relationship to her Son and because God saw fit to raise her up. "Blessed are you among women and Blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus."

              <li class="MyText PBD1">A person&apos;s life is patterned on the life of Jesus. Jesus was conceived, born, grew in grace, wisdom and age. As an adult, He worked at a trade, carried on His ministry with difficulty. He suffered, died and was buried. Let us reflect on the mystery of suffering. Jesus suffered a bitter agony and the cruel scourging to lead us on the way to the Father. Let our prayer intention be that <span class="Deceased"></span>, having accepted the suffering of life, may be at peace with the Lord.
              <li class="MyText PBD2">Now let us consider how Jesus willingly bore our sins when He was crowned with thorns, carried His cross to Calvary and was then crucified on the cross in a supreme act of love. Let our intention be that <span class="Deceased"></span> having carried his/her cross, may now share the glory of a true disciple.
              <li class="MyText PBD3">Now let us reflect on the Glorious Mystery of Jesus rising from the dead. Jesus said: <b>I am the Resurrection and the life, whoever believes in Me, though he should die, will come to life.</b> This is the glory of Easter and of our faith; that we too will be raised to glory. Let our intention be that <span class="Deceased"></span> , having believed in the Lord is now with Him in glory.
              <li class="MyText PBD4">Now let us contemplate the Ascension of Jesus into heaven and His sending us the Holy Spirit. Before Jesus returned to the Father, He promised the Apostles and all disciples present and future, that He was returning to the Father to prepare a place for them, that He would send His Spirit to guide them and that He would be with them until the end of time. Let our intention be that <span class="Deceased"></span> &apos;s family and all others who mourn loved ones, be assured that they have reached the place that Jesus prepared for them.
              <li class="MyText PBD5">Now let us reflect on the role of the Blessed Virgin Mary in our Christian life by considering the meaning of her Assumption into Heaven and her Coronation as Queen of Heaven. Mary is honored by God and all humankind. She was the most perfect disciple and the model of all the saints. Because of her perfect faith and obedience, her standing at the foot of the cross of Jesus; all Catholics believe she was assumed into Heaven, and was honored not only by God, but by all the angels and saints as well. We don&apos;t know exactly what her reward was but in our finite way, we say she was crowned with Glory and honor. Her crown of sparking jewels is a symbol of her reward. Let our intention be that <span class="Deceased"></span> also receives the reward of his/her faith.
